# myFirstJavaWebApp_Alpha

This app contains full CRUD made with technologies like Java Spring, H2 Database, Maven, Thymeleaf and Lombok.
It is my first app made with Java Spring. It is not finished even in half, but solid foundations for sure it has.
This app is some kind of film library, where You can add, edit, delete, view  Movie, Director etc...

Cheers,
Matthew
